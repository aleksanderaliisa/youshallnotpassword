This is a diary app, where you can write your own diary entries everyday every hour, whenever you want!

It has a password that keeps your entires secure!

You can choose to write an entry, then add tags and catogories to it, to make it easy to find later. It will save the entry as a txt file on your computer.
You can also read your written entries by date, or by searching for the tags or keywords you have added earlier on.

You can also add Markdown to your textfile,the code renders the markdown tags.

Happy journaling!
